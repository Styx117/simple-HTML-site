		<h1>Devil May Cry 5</h1><br>
		<p>Devil May Cry is an action-adventure hack and slash third-person shooter video game series developed by Capcom and created by Hideki Kamiya. The series centers on the main character Dante's goal of avenging his mother's murder by exterminating demons. The gameplay consists of heavy combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks while avoiding damage in order to exhibit stylized combat; this element along with time and the number of items collected and used are taken under consideration when grading the player's performance. </p>
		<br>
		<div class="img"><img src="pics/DMC.JPG" alt="DMC" style="width:100%;"></div>

		<p>The fifth installment of the mainline DMC series, Devil May Cry 5 is scheduled to be released on 8 March 2019, The gameplay will feature the return of Dante and Nero as playable characters, along with a new character, named "V". The gameplay is similar to the other titles in the Devil May Cry series, focusing on fast-paced "stylish action". The player fights off hordes of demons with a variety of attacks and weapons and receives a style-rating in combat based on a number of factors, such as move variety, the length of a combo and dodging attacks. The music in the game will change based on the player's performance in combat.</p>
