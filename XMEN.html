		<h1>X-MEN Origins: Wolverine</h1><br>
		<p>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a hack and slash action-adventure game loosely based on the film of the same name. The game release coincided with the release of the film on May 1, 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, Wii, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed primarily by Raven Software through the use of Unreal Engine technology. Amaze Entertainment developed the Wii and PS2 ports and Griptonite Games developed the PSP and DS ports. </p>

		<p>X-Men Origins takes influences from games such as God of War and Devil May Cry with a third person perspective. The Uncaged Edition also features a large amount of blood and gore. Enemies can be dismembered in several ways in addition to the graphic display of Wolverine's healing factor. Combat relies on three options - light attacks, heavy attacks, and grabs. Another form of attack is the lunge, which allows Wolverine to quickly close the distance to an enemy. Wolverine can also use the environment to his advantage, such as by impaling foes on spikes. During combat, Wolverine's rage meter builds up, and when full allows him to use more devastating attacks, like the claw spin and a berserker mode, which increases Wolverine's claw strength until his Rage Meter empties. Experience (XP) is collected from defeating enemies, destroying elements and accumulating collectibles. The XP is used to level up, and each new level results in gaining skill points, which are used to purchase upgrades.</p>

			<h2>Characters:</h2>
			<h3>Logan (Wolverine):</h3>

				<p class=" col-lg-8 smallImgTxt">
					Wolverine (birth name: James Howlett colloquial: Logan, Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities. His healing factor is facilitated by artificial improvements he was subjected to under the Weapon X program, in which his skeleton was reinforced with the virtually indestructible metal adamantium. This game shows the story of Logan's origin, how he came to be Wolverine, his emotions, the people around him and their actions, this includes the Weapon X program.

			<h3>Sabertooth (Victor Creed):</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-4 smallImg"><img src="pics/victor.JPG" alt="Icarus" style="width:100%;"></div>
				<p class=" col-lg-8 smallImgTxt">
					Sabretooth (Victor Creed) is an enemy of Wolverine, possessing bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses. He is a vicious assassin, responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure. Wolverine and Sabretooth were participants of the Cold War supersoldier program Weapon X, and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them. In the game, Victor Creed is presented as Wolverine's step-brother who is similar to Wolverine expect that he is more brutal and almost emotionless, this leads to their bond weakening over time and evenetually being severed.

			<h3>William Stryker:</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-4 smallImg"><img src="pics/stryker.JPG" alt="Kruger" style="width:100%;"></div>
				<p class=" col-lg-8 smallImgTxt">
					William Stryker is a religious fanatic, with a military history which may have involved the Weapon X project (the same project that results in Wolverine being given the adamantium skeleton). Stryker is characterized by his unequivocal hatred of mutants. So strong is this hatred that Stryker goes so far as to kill his own wife and mutant son Jason Stryker immediately after his son's birth in Nevada. Crazed and outraged, Stryker then makes a suicide attempt. As time passes, he is convinced that Satan has a plot to destroy humankind by corrupting prenatal souls, the result of this corruption being mutants. Additionally, Stryker eventually comes to see the birth of his mutant son as a sign from God, directing him to his true calling: ensuring the eradication of all mutants.
