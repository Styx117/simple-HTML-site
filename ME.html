		<h1>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</h1><br>
		<p>Mirror's Edge Catalyst is a reboot of the original game, Mirror's Edge and is a first-person action-adventure platformer game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. Its plot focuses on protagonist Faith Connors' origins. Mirror's Edge Catalyst received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release, with most reviewers praising the free-running gameplay and visuals, but criticizing the story and combat. </p>

		<div class="img"><img src="pics/ME.JPG" alt="Mirror's Edge" style="width:100%;"></div>

		<p>The player takes control of Faith Connors as she progresses through a futuristic city named Glass. Similar to the original Mirror's Edge, players traverse the city using aspects of urban exploration and parkour movements to complete missions and evade or fight enemies. Players can also make use of environmental objects such as zip-lines and ledges, and equipment; this includes a MAG (Manifold Attachment Gear) Rope and a Disruptor to travel across buildings, disable certain systems (such as large fans or security cameras) and aid Faith during combat.</p>
